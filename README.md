# Vertical Mobi Project Flutter Architecture Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the architecture employed in the Vertical Mobi Project, a Flutter application developed under your guidance. The project follows a structured approach, ensuring modularity, reusability, and testability. Utilizing the Flutter framework and Dart language, the application is designed to maintain a clear separation of concerns, allowing for scalability and easy maintenance.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 API/Data Services Layer

The API/Data Services layer acts as the external data source for the application. It interacts with external APIs, demonstrated using PHP in this context, to fetch and send data.

### 2.2 Provider Layer

The Provider layer serves as the first internal layer, mediating between the API/Data Services layer and the Service layer. It defines a contract through the Provider Protocol, ensuring that necessary functions are implemented for data retrieval and manipulation.

#### Provider Class Example:
```dart
class PlaceProvider implements PlaceProviderProtocol {
  // Implementation of CRUD operations using API services
}
```

### 2.3 Service Layer

The Service layer handles raw data obtained from the Provider layer. It encapsulates business logic, data processing, and error handling. The Service layer then delivers processed data to the Data Object Model layer and manages user interactions.

#### Service Class Example:
```dart
class PlaceService extends ServiceProtocol {
  // Implementation of CRUD operations, error handling, and business logic
}
```

### 2.4 Data Object Model Layer
The Data Object Model provides a structured representation of application data. It defines specific data objects, processes raw data, and prepares it for presentation in the user interface.

#### Data Object Model Example:
```dart
class PlaceDataObject {
  // Definition of structured data objects and data processing methods
}

extension ExtPlace on Place {
  // Extension methods for data processing specific to the Place model
}
```

### 2.5 View Layer
The View layer represents the user interface components of the application. It receives processed data from the Data Object Model and presents it to users. Here, you design the layout and user interactions, utilizing the processed data without needing additional processing.

#### View Example:
```dart
class PlaceListView extends StatefulWidget {
  // Implementation of UI components and user interactions
}
```

### 2.6 Routes
The Routes layer manages navigation and dependency injection within the application. It provides a structured way to navigate between different views and components while maintaining a separation of concerns.
